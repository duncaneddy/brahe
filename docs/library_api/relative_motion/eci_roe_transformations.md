# ECI-ROE Transformations

Transformations between Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) state vectors and Relative Orbital Elements (ROE).

These functions combine the ECI↔KOE and OE↔ROE transformations to provide direct conversion between inertial Cartesian states and quasi-nonsingular Relative Orbital Elements.

!!! note
    For conceptual explanations of ROE, see [ROE Transformations](../../learn/relative_motion/roe_transformations.md).
