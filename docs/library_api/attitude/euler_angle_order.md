# EulerAngleOrder Enum

The `EulerAngleOrder` enumeration specifies the rotation sequence for Euler angle representations. There are 12 possible sequences: 6 symmetric sequences where the first and third rotations are about the same axis, and 6 asymmetric sequences where all rotations are about different axes.
