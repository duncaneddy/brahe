# Computing Imaging Opportunities

!!! note "Coming Soon"
    This example is under development. Check back soon for details on computing imaging opportunities.

## Overview

This example will demonstrate how to compute when a satellite can image a specific target location on Earth.

## Complete Example

Combine locations, constraints, and configuration for a realistic imaging scenario:

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    --8<-- "./examples/access/computation/imaging_opportunities.py:8"
    ```

=== "Rust"

    ``` rust
    --8<-- "./examples/access/computation/imaging_opportunities.rs:4"
    ```
