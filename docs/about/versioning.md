# Versioning

Brahe generally tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to manage its version numbers, with new features added in minor releases and breaking changes reserved for major releases. However, this may be violated for experimental features or urgent fixes with breaking changes in minor releases. Users are encouraged to read the release notes for each version to understand any potential breaking changes.

## Current Experimental Features

Some features in Brahe are currently marked as experimental. These features are functional but more likely to undergo changes in minor releases as we refine their design and implementation. Experimental features are indicated in the documentation with a warning box.

Current experimental features include:

1. Numerical Integration Module
2. Space Weather Module
3. Atmospheric Density Models (NRLMSISE-00)
4. Numerical Propagation
