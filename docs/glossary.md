| Term | Definition | 
|------|------------|
| Aphelion | Furthest point away for a Sun-orbiting object from the Sun. |
| Apoapsis | Furthest point away for an orbiting object from its orbital focus. |
| Apogee | Furthest point away for a Earth-orbiting object from the Earth. |
| Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) | A rotating reference frame with its coordinate origin at the center of the Earth. Reference frame rotates with Earth's crustal (surface) |
| Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) | An inertial reference frame or system with its coordinate origin at the Earth's center of mass. In an inertial reference frame Newtwon's Laws are applicable, meaning that no corrections for fictitious, observer-based forces like the Coriolis Force have to be performed. | 
| Osculating Orbital Elements | Instantaneous orbital elements describing the satellite trajectory for a specific time if no perturbations beyond point-mass gravity were present  |
| Mean Motion | Average angular rate a satellite progresses through its orbit. |  
| Periapsis | Point of closest approach for an orbiting object with respect to its orbital focus. |
| Perihelion | Point of closest approach for an Sun-orbiting object with respect to the Sun. |
| Perigee | Point of closest approach for an Earth-orbiting object with respect to the Earth. |
