# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation for Brahe. This documentation is designed to help you get up and running with the project 
as quickly as possible. It is designed to walk you through getting setup and running step by step. It provides
examples of using the library to solve common problems. It is not meant to be an exhaustive reference of all library 
functions. For that see the Rust and Python API references.
