# Access Computation

Access computation determines when and under what conditions satellites can observe or communicate with ground locations. This is fundamental for mission planning, ground station contact scheduling, imaging opportunity analysis, and communications link budgets.

Brahe provides a comprehensive access computation system that handles the geometric complexity of satellite-ground visibility while offering flexibility through constraints, extensible properties, and performance optimization.
