# Event Detectors

Core event detector classes for detecting specific conditions during numerical propagation.

## TimeEvent

Detects when propagation reaches a specific target time.

::: brahe.TimeEvent

## ValueEvent

Detects when a user-defined value function crosses a target threshold.

::: brahe.ValueEvent

## BinaryEvent

Detects boolean condition transitions (edges) based on a user-defined condition function.

::: brahe.BinaryEvent
