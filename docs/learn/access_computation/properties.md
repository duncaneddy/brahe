# Access Properties

Access properties provide additional information about satellite-location access windows.

## Overview

When computing access between satellites and ground locations, you can extract various properties for each access window such as:

- Maximum elevation angle
- Azimuth and elevation at specific times
- Range and range rate
- Local time of access

## Property Types

Properties can be computed at different points during an access window:

- **At access start**: Initial conditions when satellite becomes visible
- **At maximum elevation**: Conditions at the peak of the pass
- **At access end**: Final conditions when satellite is no longer visible
