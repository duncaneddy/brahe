# Jacobian Computation

Jacobian matrix computation utilities for numerical integration and variational equations.

## Overview

Brahe provides both analytical and numerical Jacobian computation through a unified interface. Jacobian matrices describe how a function's output changes with respect to its inputs, which is essential for orbit determination, uncertainty propagation, and trajectory optimization.
