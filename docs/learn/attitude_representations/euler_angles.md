# Euler Angles

Euler angles represent rotations as three sequential rotations about coordinate axes.

## Overview

Euler angles describe orientation using three angles representing sequential rotations about specified axes. Brahe supports all 12 possible Euler angle sequences (e.g., XYZ, ZYX, ZYZ).

## Mathematical Representation

An Euler angle rotation is specified by:

- Three angles: $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$
- A rotation sequence (e.g., XYZ, ZYX)

## Sequences

Brahe supports all valid Euler angle sequences, though some are more commonly used are:

- **ZYX (3-2-1)**: Common in aerospace applications. Known as yaw-pitch-roll.
- **XYZ (1-2-3)**: Common in robotics
- **ZYZ (3-1-3)**: Common in classical mechanics

## Initialization

Euler angles can be created from individual angles with a specified rotation sequence, or converted from other attitude representations. When creating a new `EulerAngle` object, the rotation sequence of the created object must be specified.
