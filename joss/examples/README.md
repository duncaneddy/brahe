# JOSS Examples

This folder contains scripts directly implementing the examples shown in the JOSS paper for Brahe. Each script is implemented as a [`uv` script](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) with the necessary metadata at the top of the file.
These scripts can be run directly using the `uv run` command if you have the [Astral UV tool](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

For example, to run the `core_functions.py` example, you would use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uv run joss/examples/core_functions.py
```
