# Euler Angles

Euler angles represent rotations as three sequential rotations about coordinate axes.

## Overview

Euler angles describe orientation using three angles representing sequential rotations about specified axes. Brahe supports all 12 possible Euler angle sequences (e.g., XYZ, ZYX, ZYZ).

## Mathematical Representation

An Euler angle rotation is specified by:

- Three angles: $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$
- A rotation sequence (e.g., XYZ, ZYX)

## Common Sequences

- **ZYX (Yaw-Pitch-Roll)**: Common in aerospace applications
- **XYZ**: Common in robotics
- **ZYZ**: Common in classical mechanics
